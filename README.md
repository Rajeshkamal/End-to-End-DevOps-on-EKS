Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle on AWS EKS, implemented using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and modern DevOps tools.
It covers CI/CD pipeline automation, artifact management, code quality analysis, container orchestration, and monitoring ‚Äî making it a real-world, production-grade setup.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

Infrastructure: Terraform, AWS EKS
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Webhooks
Artifact Management: Nexus
Code Quality & Security: SonarQube, Trivy
Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana
Database: MySQL with Backup & PVC
Ingress & Security: Nginx Ingress, SSL/TLS Certificates

üîÑ CI/CD Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ CI (Continuous Integration)

Code is pushed to GitHub ‚Üí Webhook triggers Jenkins pipeline
Pre-Build Phase: Compile, Test, Quality Check (SonarQube)
Build Phase: Docker Image build, pushed to DockerHub, stored in Nexus
Post-Build Phase: Notifications (Email/Slack)

2Ô∏è‚É£ CD (Continuous Deployment)

Jenkins triggers deployment to EKS
Kubernetes manifests (Helm/Terraform) deploy app + MySQL DB
SSL enabled via Cert-Manager & Ingress
Continuous monitoring via Prometheus & Grafana

‚≠ê Key Highlights

End-to-End CI/CD: From code commit ‚Üí to deployment on EKS
Complete Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
Security & Quality: Trivy scans + SonarQube checks
Scalable Architecture: Runs on AWS EKS with Terraform IaC
Production Ready: SSL, Ingress, Secrets, and Backups
